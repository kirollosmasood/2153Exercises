Perhaps you have lain awake at night, thinking it is impossible to calculate $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}dx$. After all, we typically evaluate improper integrals by first computing a proper integral and then taking limits. That strategy uses the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but there is no closed-form expression for $\int e^{-x^2} dx$. Thankfully, we have other methods at our disposal. But we'll need to proceed with finesse since we don't have the heavy machinery of multivariable calculus.

Let's first define a few functions that will help us out.
\begin{align*}
	&F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} e^{-x^2}dx \\
	&G(t)=\int_{0}^{1} \frac{e^{-t^2(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2} dx \\
	$H(t)=F(t)^2+G(t)
\end{align*}
The first function looks relevant, but it's not clear yet how the other ones will help us. Still, let's move on by exploring $H$.
