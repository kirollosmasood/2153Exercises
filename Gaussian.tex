Perhaps you have lain awake at night, thinking it is impossible to calculate $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}dx$. After all, we typically evaluate improper integrals by first computing a proper integral and then taking limits. That strategy uses the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but there is no closed-form expression for $\int e^{-x^2} dx$. Thankfully, we have other methods at our disposal. But we'll need to proceed with finesse since we don't have the heavy machinery of multivariable calculus.

Let's first define a few functions that will help us out.
\begin{align*}
	&F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} e^{-x^2}dx \\
	&G(t)=\int_{0}^{1} \frac{e^{-t^2(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2} dx \\
	&H(t)=F(t)^2+G(t)
\end{align*}
The first function looks relevant, but it's not clear yet how the other ones will help us. Still, let's move on by exploring $H$.
\begin{align*}
H(0)= F(0)^2+H(0)=\left[\int_{0}^{0} e^{-x^2}dx \right]^2+\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx =  \left[ \answer[given]{0} \right]^2 + \answer[given]{\pi/4} = \answer[given]{\pi/4}
\end{align*}

Next, let's find $H'(t)$. We can find the derivative of $F$ using the \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}\choice{Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}\choice{Third Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}\choice{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}\choice{Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry}}. Now even though the limits of integration in $H$ don't depend on $t$, the integrand does. So to evaluate $H'(t)$, you may simply pull the derivative (with respect to $t$) inside and treat $x$ like a constant.
\begin{align*}
H'(t) =2F(t)F'(t)+H'(t) \\
=2 \left[ \int_{0}^{t} e^{-x^2}dx \right] \left[ e^{-t^2} \right]+\int_{0}^{1} \frac{ (-2t(1+x^2)) e^{-t^2(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2} dx \\
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
	After some simplification, we get
	$$
	H'(t) =2F(t)F'(t)+H'(t) \\
	=2 \left[ \int_{0}^{t} e^{-x^2}dx \right] \left[ e^{-t^2} \right]+\int_{0}^{1} \frac{ (-2t(1+x^2)) e^{-t^2(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2} dx \\
	$$
