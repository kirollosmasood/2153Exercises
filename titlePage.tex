\begin{sectionOutcomes}
	As the semester progresses, I will upload various activities related to the material in the course. These problems are entirely optional; they are not calculated into your final grade. However, their benefits are numerous:
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item
		You gain additional experience with the topics we cover in class.
		
		\item
		These problems are longer and more rigorous than the typical problems you will find on your homeworks. As a result, they will hone your skills and truly test to see if you have mastered the concepts we've discussed.
		
		\item
		Aside from being challenging, the exercise often provide very useful insight into profound mathematical questions.
		
		\item
		It's the best thing you could do on a Friday night.
		
	\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
	Are you ready to start learning some Calculus!?!
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice[correct]{Yes I am!}
	\end{multipleChoice}
	\begin{hint}
		We promise the real course will not be this corny.
