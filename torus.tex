\title{Solid Torus}

In this activity, we will use a case study to help us better understand solids of revolution.

By now, you may have seen some rather creative shapes constructed by rotating various regions in the $xy$-plane about an axis. Let us take a closer look at yet another.
\begin{definition}
	A \dfn{torus} with radii $R$ and $r$ is the surface obtained by rotating a circle of radius $r$ centered at $(0,R)$ about the $y$-axis.
\end{definition}

\begin{image}

	\includegraphics{torus.jpg}
\end{image}

\begin{remark}
	In our definition, we chose to center our circle on the $x$-axis and revolve around the $y$-axis. We could have done it vice versa and gotten the same shape, but oriented differently. We just made a choice so we can set up integrals.
\end{remark} 

We may fill in this circle and rotate the disc around to get a solid of revolution, which we will call a solid torus.

\begin{exercise}
	Naturally, we may ask how much volume there is in the new shape we constructed. Let's try to answer this question by setting up an integral with respect to $y$. This means we'll be using the  \wordChoice{\choice{shell method}\choice[correct]{washer method}\choice{nail method}\choice{turtle method}}.
	
	Since $y$ is our independent variable, we'll need to solve for $x$ to get our ``top'' and ``bottom'' functions, or in this case, right and left.
	
%	$$x_{\mathit{right}}(y) = \answer[given]{R+\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}$$ \\
%	$$x_{\mathit{left}}(y) = \answer[given]{R-\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}$$

	\begin{exericse}
		Now we may set up our integral.
		\begin{align*}
			V  &= \int_{\answer[given]{-R}}^{\answer[given]{R}} \pi [ (R+\sqrt{r^2-y^2})^{2}-(R-\sqrt{r^2-y^2})^{2}] dy \\
		\end{align*}
	\end{exercise}
