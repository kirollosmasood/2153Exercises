\title{Solid Torus}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
In this activity, we will use a case study to help us better understand solids of revolution.

\maketitle

By now, you may have seen some rather creative shapes constructed by rotating various regions in the $xy$-plane about an axis. Let us take a closer look at yet another.
\begin{definition}
	A \dfn{torus} with radii $R$ and $r$ is the surface obtained by rotating a circle of radius $r$ centered at $(0,R)$ about the $y$-axis.
\end{definition}

\begin{image}
	\label{torus}
	\includegraphics{torus.jpg}
\end{image}

\begin{remark}
	In our definition, we chose to center our circle on the $x$-axis and revolve around the $y$-axis. We could have done it vice versa and gotten the same shape, but oriented differently. We just made a choice so we can set up integrals.
\end{remark} 

We may fill in this circle and rotate the disc around to get a solid of revolution, which we will call a solid torus.

\begin{exercise}
	Naturally, we may ask how much volume there is in the new shape we constructed. Let's try to answer this question by setting up an integral with respect to $y$. This means we'll be using the  \wordChoice{\choice{shell method}\choice[correct]{washer method}\choice{nail method}\choice{turtle method}}.
	
	Since $y$ is our independent variable, we'll need to solve for $x$ to get our ``top'' and ``bottom'' functions, or in this case, right and left.
	
	$$x_{\mathit{right}}(y) = \answer[given]{R+\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}$$ \\
	$$x_{\mathit{left}}(y) = \answer[given]{R-\sqrt{r^2-y^2}}$$
	
	Now we may set up our integral.
	\begin{align*}
		V  &= \int_{\answer[given]{-R}}^{\answer[given]{R}} \pi [ (R+\sqrt{r^2-y^2})^{2}-(R-\sqrt{r^2-y^2})^{2}] dy \\
	\end{align*}
	\begin{exercise}
		\begin{align*}
			&= \int_{-R}^{R} \pi [ (R+(r^2-y^2)^{1/2})^{2}-(R-(r^2-y^2)^{1/2})^{2}] dy
		\end{align*}
		$\answer{a}$
	\end{exercise}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	Find the absolute maximum and minimum of $F(x,y) = 5x-7y$ constrained to the closed set bounded by $y=x^2$ and $y=1$.
	
	\begin{prompt}
		How many crtical points are there in this closed set?
		\[
		\answer{1}
		\]
		\begin{exercise}
			This critical point is at:
			\[
			\vec{c} = \vector{\answer{5/14},\answer{25/196}}
			\]
		\end{exercise}
		\begin{exercise}
			\begin{hint}
				Remember to check the corners.
			\end{hint}
			The absolute maximum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
			\[
			F\left(\answer{5/14},\answer{25/196}\right) = \answer{25/28}
			\]
			The absolute minimum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
			\[
			F\left(\answer{-1},\answer{1}\right) = \answer{-12}
			\]
		\end{exercise}
	\end{prompt}
\end{exercise}
